# 🚀 Tenable Integration Testing Guide

## ✅ Great! Your Server is Working!

Now let's proceed with comprehensive testing of your Tenable Security Center integration.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Testing Process

### Step 1: Run the Complete Test Suite

Open in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/test_tenable_complete.php
```

### Step 2: Enter Your Real Tenable Credentials

Fill in the form with your actual credentials:

- **Tenable SC Host URL**: `https://your-actual-tenable-sc.com`
  - Must include `https://`
  - Use your real Tenable Security Center URL

- **Access Key**: Your actual API access key
  - Get this from Tenable SC → My Account → API Keys

- **Secret Key**: Your actual API secret key
  - This is shown only once when you create the API key

### Step 3: Click "Run Complete Integration Test"

The test will run for **2-10 minutes** depending on your data volume.

**⚠️ Important:**
- Don't close the browser tab while tests are running
- Don't refresh the page
- Keep the Terminal window open (where PHP server is running)
- You'll see real-time progress updates

## 📊 What Gets Tested

### Test 1: Connection & Authentication ⏱️ ~5 seconds
- Verifies API connectivity
- Validates credentials
- Checks response time

**Expected Result:** ✅ Connection successful with HTTP 200

---

### Test 2: New Vulnerabilities Query ⏱️ ~30-60 seconds
Tests queries for new vulnerabilities in the last 30 days:
- Critical severity
- High severity
- Medium severity
- Low severity

**Expected Result:** ✅ Returns count of new vulnerabilities for each severity

---

### Test 3: Closed Vulnerabilities Query ⏱️ ~30-60 seconds
Tests queries for closed/mitigated vulnerabilities:
- Critical severity
- High severity
- Medium severity
- Low severity

**Expected Result:** ✅ Returns count of closed vulnerabilities for each severity

---

### Test 4: Current Vulnerabilities & VGI Methods ⏱️ ~1-8 minutes

This is the most important test! It validates all three optimization methods:

#### Method 1: sumid with count field (⚡ FASTEST)
- Uses optimized API endpoint
- Minimal API calls
- Expected time: 2-5 seconds per severity

#### Method 2: bulk export with aggregation (🚀 RECOMMENDED)
- Exports vulnerability data in bulk
- Aggregates on client side
- Expected time: 30-60 seconds per severity

#### Method 3: individual plugin queries (🐌 FALLBACK)
- Queries each plugin individually
- Most API calls
- Expected time: 2-10 minutes per severity

**Expected Result:** ✅ At least one method works for each severity level

---

### Test 5: VGI Calculation ⏱️ ~1 second
Validates the Vulnerability Generic Index formula:
```
VGI = (Critical×4 + High×3 + Medium×2 + Low×1) / 100
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Calculation matches expected formula

---

### Test 6: Performance Analysis ⏱️ ~1 second
Compares all methods:
- Query times
- API call counts
- Efficiency ratings
- Recommendations

**Expected Result:** ✅ Performance table showing which method is fastest

---

## 🎯 Understanding Test Results

### ✅ All Tests Pass (IDEAL)
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ✅ All Tests Passed!                                     ║
║                                                           ║
║  Your Tenable Security Center integration is working     ║
║  perfectly. You can now safely run va_demo.php           ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**What to do next:**
1. ✅ Review the performance recommendations
2. ✅ Note which VGI method worked best
3. ✅ Proceed to run the main application: `http://localhost:8080/va_demo.php`

---

### ⚠️ Some Tests Pass, Some Fail (COMMON)

**Scenario A: Method 1 fails, but Method 2 or 3 works**
```
❌ Method 1 (sumid) - FAILED
✅ Method 2 (bulk export) - PASSED
⏭️ Method 3 (individual) - SKIPPED
```

**This is NORMAL and ACCEPTABLE!**
- The system automatically falls back to working methods
- Your integration will work fine
- Method 2 or 3 will be used automatically

**What to do next:**
1. ✅ Note which method works
2. ✅ Proceed to main application
3. ℹ️ Expect slightly slower performance (but still acceptable)

---

**Scenario B: Connection test fails**
```
❌ Connection Test - FAILED
Error: Could not connect to host
```

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong URL (check https:// is included)
- Network/VPN not connected
- Firewall blocking connection
- Tenable SC server is down

**What to do:**
1. ❌ Verify URL in browser first
2. ❌ Check network connectivity
3. ❌ Try from Tenable SC web interface
4. ❌ Contact your network admin

---

**Scenario C: Authentication fails**
```
✅ Connection Test - PASSED
❌ Authentication - FAILED (401 Unauthorized)
```

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong Access Key
- Wrong Secret Key
- API key expired
- API key doesn't have required permissions

**What to do:**
1. ❌ Double-check Access Key (copy-paste carefully)
2. ❌ Double-check Secret Key (copy-paste carefully)
3. ❌ Verify API key in Tenable SC → My Account → API Keys
4. ❌ Check API key has "Full Access" or at least "Analysis" permissions
5. ❌ Create a new API key if needed

---

### ❌ All Tests Fail (PROBLEM)

**This indicates a serious issue:**
- Credentials are completely wrong
- Tenable SC is unreachable
- API is disabled
- Major configuration problem

**What to do:**
1. ❌ Stop and verify Tenable SC is accessible
2. ❌ Test login via web browser first
3. ❌ Verify API keys are created and active
4. ❌ Contact Tenable SC administrator
5. ❌ Check Tenable SC logs for errors

---

## ✅ After Tests Pass - Next Steps

### 1. Review Recommendations
At the end of the test, you'll see recommendations like:

```
💡 Recommendations:
• Method 2 (bulk export) is working well for your environment
• Average query time is acceptable (< 60 seconds)
• Consider running sync during off-peak hours
• Your VGI calculation is accurate
• Integration is ready for production use
```

### 2. Run the Main Application

Once tests pass, you can safely run:
```
http://localhost:8080/va_demo.php
```

This is your main Vulnerability Assessment dashboard.

### 3. Set Up Automated Sync (Optional)

If you want automatic daily updates, set up the cron job:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs daily at 2 AM)
0 2 * * * cd "/Users/ammarfahad/Downloads/Others/CTI Proj/CTI Files/CTI-main" && php va_cli.php sync
```

### 4. Monitor Performance

Keep an eye on:
- Query times (should be consistent)
- API call counts (shouldn't increase dramatically)
- VGI scores (should reflect your security posture)
- Error rates (should be near zero)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Connection timeout"
**Solution:**
- Increase timeout in test file (already set to 10 minutes)
- Run test during off-peak hours
- Check network stability
- Try "Quick Test" mode first

### Issue: "Method 1 and 2 fail, only Method 3 works"
**Solution:**
- This is acceptable but slow
- Check Tenable SC API version (might be older)
- Verify API permissions include "Analysis" access
- Consider upgrading Tenable SC if very old

### Issue: "Inconsistent results between methods"
**Solution:**
- This is normal due to timing differences
- Vulnerabilities change in real-time
- Small differences (< 5%) are acceptable
- Large differences indicate a problem - contact support

### Issue: "Test hangs/freezes"
**Solution:**
- Wait up to 10 minutes (timeout)
- Check Terminal for PHP errors
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Try refreshing and running again
- Try "Quick Test" mode

### Issue: "Memory exhausted"
**Solution:**
- You have a LOT of vulnerabilities (good problem to have!)
- Edit test file: increase `memory_limit`
- Run during off-peak hours
- Use "Quick Test" mode
- Contact support for optimization
