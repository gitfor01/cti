## 📊 Visualization Details

### Bar Chart Specifications:
- **Chart Type:** Vertical bar chart with zero baseline
- **X-Axis:** Months (rotated labels at 45° for readability)
- **Y-Axis:** Net change in vulnerabilities (positive/negative scale)
- **Grid Lines:** Subtle gray lines for easy reading
- **Bar Width:** Automatically calculated based on number of months
- **Spacing:** 20% of bar width for clean separation

### Color Scheme:
```
Positive Net Change (Bad):  #fc8181 (Red)
Negative Net Change (Good): #68d391 (Green)
No Change (Neutral):        #a0aec0 (Gray)
```

## 📈 Statistics Cards

Both dashboards now display:

1. **Total New Vulnerabilities**
   - Sum of all new vulnerabilities across all months
   - Purple gradient background

2. **Total Closed Vulnerabilities**
   - Sum of all closed vulnerabilities across all months
   - Purple gradient background

3. **Net Change**
   - Total new minus total closed
   - Shows + or - prefix
   - Purple gradient background

4. **Current VGI**
   - Latest Vulnerability Generic Index value
   - Orange gradient background
   - Formula: ((Critical×4) + (High×3) + (Medium×2) + (Low×1)) ÷ 100

5. **Average VGI Change**
   - Average change in VGI across all months
   - Shows + or - prefix
   - Orange gradient background

## 🎨 Enhanced Tooltips

### Main Dashboard Tooltip:
- Month name
- New vulnerabilities
- Closed vulnerabilities
- Net change (color-coded)
- VGI value

### Demo Dashboard Tooltip:
**More detailed with severity breakdowns:**

**Section 1: New Vulnerabilities**
- Critical (with red dot)
- High (with orange dot)
- Medium (with yellow dot)
- Low (with green dot)
- Total new count

**Section 2: Closed Vulnerabilities**
- Critical (with red dot)
- High (with orange dot)
- Medium (with yellow dot)
- Low (with green dot)
- Total closed count

**Section 3: Current Status**
- Current vulnerability counts by severity
- Total current vulnerabilities

**Section 4: VGI Metrics**
- Current VGI value
- VGI change from previous month

---

## 🔄 Status Indicator

Dynamic status indicator at the bottom shows:

- **🔺 Growing** (Red): Net change is positive - vulnerability backlog increasing
- **✅ Decreasing** (Green): Net change is negative - vulnerability backlog decreasing
- **➖ Stable** (Gray): Net change is zero - vulnerability backlog stable

## 📝 Notes

### Why Bar Charts?
- **Clearer visualization** of net changes (positive/negative)
- **Easier comparison** between months
- **Better for trend analysis** over time
- **More intuitive** for stakeholders
- **Professional appearance** for reports

### VGI Calculation:
The Vulnerability Generic Index (VGI) provides a weighted score that considers both the severity of vulnerabilities and the number of affected assets:

```
VGI = ((Critical_instances × 4) + 
       (High_instances × 3) + 
       (Medium_instances × 2) + 
       (Low_instances × 1)) ÷ 100
```

Where "instances" = total affected assets across all vulnerabilities of that severity.
