## Testing

### Test Script
A test script is provided: `test_password_validation.php`

Run this script to verify password validation works correctly with various test cases.

### Manual Testing

#### Test User Password Change:
1. Log in as any user
2. Click on your username in the navigation bar
3. Try changing password with:
   - Weak password (should fail)
   - Password without symbols (should fail)
   - Valid strong password (should succeed)

#### Test Admin Password Change:
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Click key icon next to any user
4. Try changing password with:
   - Weak password (should fail)
   - Valid strong password (should succeed)

#### Test New User Creation:
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Try creating user with weak password (should fail with error message)
4. Create user with strong password (should succeed)

## Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`
2. **Current Password Verification**: Users must know their current password to change it
3. **Admin Privacy**: Admins cannot see users' current passwords
4. **Password Strength**: Enforced minimum requirements prevent weak passwords
5. **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
